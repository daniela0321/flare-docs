Enterprise is a commonly used term in the context of management practices. Note that this term does not only mean big organizations – it refers to an organization or sub-activity whose boundary is defined by commonly held goals, processes, and resources.

## 1. Organizational Culture & Management

Organizational Culture is the foundation for everything and a basis for success, and a management system of an organization provides a framework to manage and integrate all activities. 

### 1.1 Organizational Culture

*How do you achieve and maintain organizational culture and values that enable success?*

[**Organizational culture**](/insights/organizational-culture) is the expression of assumptions, values, and beliefs that parties bring to an organization. It is important as it shapes people and their experience, and therefore it is the basis for success of the organization.

### 1.2 Management System

*How do you manage and integrate all activities in an organization?*

[**Service management**](/insights/service-management) provides one way to combine, integrate and coordinate the various components and activities of an organization in a flexible way.

## 2. Practices

There is a variety of practices that provide support and guidance for the product life cycle. Some of these practices are listed below.

### 2.1 Enterprise Architecture

*How do you get an understanding of the processes, data, applications, and technologies of an organization?*

### 2.2 Business Process Management

*How do you oversee how work is performed in the organization?*

[**Business Process Management**](/insights/business-process-management/) helps to oversee how work is performed in the organization, by taking a process-oriented approach contrary to a function-oriented approach.

It happens on two dimensions – both the business side of change and the people side of change need to be addressed.
