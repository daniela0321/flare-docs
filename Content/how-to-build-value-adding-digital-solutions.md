## 1. Background

Have you been in a situation where you feel that IT and business are speaking two different languages? – Yep, been there as well.

For a significant part of our working careers, we have worked in different fields between business and IT people, trying to translate business language to technical people and vice versa. And occasionally, realizing that we have completely lost the plot ourselves…

Often the challenge is that people may be approaching issues from a different conceptual viewpoint. Jargon doesn’t help either.

One way to ease the pain is to make sure people have similar mental models, i.e. a common approach, on topics at hand. Mental models help you to structure how things work. They should contain minimal information and they are subject to change.

These types of models are especially useful for top-down thinkers. Top-down thinkers perform better when the large concepts of a topic are firmly in place (and familiar) before they start to think about collecting details, otherwise they can get completely lost. We know this from experience…

We also enjoy thinking about the kinds of digital solutions that could add real value and are worth building. All this led to our side project, creating Insights on how to build value-adding digital products.

## 2. Insights

### 2.1 What Are Insights?

How do you build value-adding digital solutions? This is a very broad question, which we try to answer by building an interconnected library of Insights that offer a top-down view to the common frameworks, processes and models used in this field.

### 2.2 Limitations

Obviously, there is no single truth, and often multiple terms are being used to describe one thing and/or terms are overlapping. However, our content presents one way to encapsulate the theories around the topics.

And naturally, you need to establish and agree the common approach in your own organization.

In addition, as we supplement the content on the way, it is constantly changing and hopefully develops over time.

### 2.3 Who Can Benefit from Them?

The theories and frameworks can be used in environments ranging from a big business to a small business, department, or product group. 

And by anyone who needs to understand the big picture and the relationships between concepts – you can use it either as an introduction to the topic, or as a refresher on the specifics you need at any time.

## 3. Where to Start?

The umbrella Insights give you an introduction to a topic and include child Insights with more information. The key for a successful development project is that these processes are integrated and work well together.

Choose where you would like to start and dive deeper to the child Insights when applicable.

### 3.1 Umbrella Insight: Product Life Cycles

[**Product life cycle**](/insights/product-lifecycles) describes the different stages in the life cycle of a product. When talking specifically about digital products, a framework for describing the development phases is called a systems development life cycle.

It’s five major components are requirements development, design, implementation, testing, and transition & operation. 

System development life cycle models, for example waterfall model or agile development model, describe how these components are executed.

### 3.2 Umbrella Insight: Governing Practices

[**Governing Practices**](/insights/governing-practices) refer to some fundamental management practices that provide essential support and governance for the product life cycle mentioned above.

In addition, it includes information on how to manage and integrate all activities in an organization, and how to cultivate the organizational culture.
