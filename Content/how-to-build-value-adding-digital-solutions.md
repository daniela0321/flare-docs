## 1. What Are Insights?

How do you build value-adding digital solutions? This is a very broad question, which we try to answer by building an interconnected library of Insights that offer a top-down view to the common frameworks, processes and models used in this field.

## 2. Why They Can Be Useful?

Often the challenge is that people may be approaching issues from a different conceptual viewpoint. Jargon doesn’t help either.

One way to ease the pain is to make sure people have similar mental models, i.e. a common approach, on topics at hand. Mental models help you to structure how things work. They should contain minimal information and they are subject to change.

Our ultimate goal is to create a ‘big picture’ on the most important subject matters and illustrate how these are related.

## 3. Limitations

Obviously, there is no single truth, and often multiple terms are being used to describe one thing and/or terms are overlapping. However, our content presents one way to encapsulate the theories around the topics.

And naturally, you need to establish and agree the common approach in your own organization.

In addition, as we supplement the content on the way, it is constantly changing and hopefully develops over time.

## 4. Who Can Benefit from Them?

The theories and frameworks can be used in environments ranging from a big business to a small business, department, or product group. 

And by anyone who needs to understand the big picture and the relationships between concepts – you can use it either as an introduction to the topic, or as a refresher on the specifics you need at any time.

## 5. Where to Start?

The umbrella Insights give you an introduction to a topic and include child Insights with more information. The key for a successful development project is that these processes are integrated and work well together.

Choose where you would like to start and dive deeper to the child Insights when applicable.

### 5.1 Umbrella Insight: Product Life Cycles

[**Digital product life cycle**](/product-lifecycles) describes the process of creating value-adding digital solutions. It’s five major components are requirements development, design, implementation, testing, and transition & operation. 

System development life cycle models, for example waterfall model or agile development model, describe how these components are executed.

### 5.2 Umbrella Insight: Governing Practices

[**Governing Practices**](/governing-practices) refer to some fundamental management practices that provide essential support and governance for the product life cycle mentioned above.

In addition, there is a need for some kind of management system, e.g. Service Management. That provides a framework to manage and integrate all activities of an organization.

Naturally, the organizational culture and values are a foundation for all the other activities mentioned above.
