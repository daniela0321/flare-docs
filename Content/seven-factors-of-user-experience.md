## 1. The 7 Factors and Their Meaning

Below you can find more information on each factor and what they mean for the overall user experience. [2] 

When working with [**service design**](/insights/service-design) and [**user experience design**](/insights/ux-design), remember to include all these considerations into your designs.

### 1.1 Valuable

First of all, the product must always deliver value. And it must deliver value both to the business creating it and to the user buying it or using it.

You should never build a product which does not create value.

### 1.2 Useful

If a product is useful, it has practical or beneficial use for someone. If this is not the case, it does not make sense to bring it to market.

However, it is worth noting that ‘useful’ is in the eye of the beholder. Therefore, things can be deemed ‘useful’ even if they deliver only non-practical benefits.

### 1.3 Usable

If a product is usable, it enables users to achieve their end objective effectively and efficiently.

Sometimes you see products succeed even if they are not usable, but especially with the growing number of well-designed products, this is less and less likely.

### 1.4 Findable

Findable means that:

- The product is easy to find
- In the case of digital and information products, the content within the product is easy to find as well.

### 1.5 Credible

If a product is credible, the user is able to trust in the product that you have provided. This means that

- The product does the job it is supposed to do
- It will last for a reasonable amount of time
- The information provided with it is accurate and fit-for-purpose.

It is nearly impossible to deliver a successful user experience if the users think the product creator has bad intentions.

### 1.6 Desirable

Desirability is manifested through branding, image, identity, aesthetics, and emotional design. The more pleasing a product is, the more likely it is that the user will tell others about it.

### 1.7 Accessible

And last but not least, accessibility. This is often forgotten when creating user experiences. 

Accessibility is about providing an experience which can be accessed by users with a full range of abilities. This should always include those who are disabled in some way like the hearing, vision, motion, or learning impaired.

Accessible design is now a legal obligation in many jurisdictions, such as the EU. In addition, when you design for accessibility, the products are often easier for everyone to use, not just those with disabilities.
