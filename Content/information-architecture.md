## 1. What Is Information Architecture?

Information Architecture (IA) is all about organizing information in a meaningful way â€“ the goal is that the user can easily find the information (when needed) through proper organization, navigation, labelling, and searching systems. In addition, good information architecture ensures that there is no information breakdown or explosion with the scaling of information overtime. [1]

## 2. Types of Information Architecture

Joe Natoli has listed examples of types of information architecture on websites and mobile applications. [2]

### 2.1 Hierarchical Structure

An index page and a series of sub-pages.
