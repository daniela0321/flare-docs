## 1. What Is Service Management?

In a modern business organization, every department relies on information technology (IT) to carry out its role effectively and efficiently.

Service Management provides a way to combine, integrate and coordinate the various components and activities of an organization in a flexible way. It offers: [1]

- An end-to-end service approach – it gives a structure of working in the whole organization.
